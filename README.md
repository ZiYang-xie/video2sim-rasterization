# Vid2Sim Differential Gaussian Rasterization

This is a modified version of the original [diff-gaussian-rasterization](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization) repository to support rasterizing `depth`, `normal`, `extra` and `gs_w` attributes.

Here's an example of our Vid2Sim modified differential gaussian rasterization repo
```python
from diff_gauss import GaussianRasterizationSettings, GaussianRasterizer

gs_w = None
rendered_image, rendered_depth, rendered_norm, rendered_alpha, radii, extra, gs_w = rasterizer(
    means3D = means3D,
    means2D = means2D,
    shs = shs,
    colors_precomp = colors_precomp,
    opacities = opacity,
    scales = scales,
    rotations = rotations,
    cov3Ds_precomp = cov3D_precomp,
    extra_attrs = extra_attrs
)
```
